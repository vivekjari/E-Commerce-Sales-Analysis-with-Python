## E-commerce Supply Chain Analysis

We have a dataset from an E-commerce company selling variety of products of product type namely: skincare, haircare and cosmetics.

By using python and its libraries, dataset is being analysed to look for any trend or relation in the sale of the products.

As an analyst we want to explore the data and answer the following questions using the past data:

-What is the revenue generated vs price of the product?
-Which product type has the highest sale?  
- what is total revenue generated from shipping carrier?
- what is the shipping cast according to carrier?
-What is the defect rate per product type?

## Data

- ***Product data:*** Product type, SKU, Price, manufacturing costs, defect rate, etc.
- ***Customer data:***  customer demographics, order quantities,  etc.
- ***Carrier data:***  Transportation routes, modes, costs etc.
- ***Sales data:***  number of products sold, revenue generated, etc.

## Tasks

To clean the available data and prepare the data for EDA. 

Using Python libraries (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Plotly), we want to plot visualizations so as to answer above mentioned questions.

## Checkpoints

The checkpoints for the assignment are as follows:

1. To import the libraries required for the task in jyputer notebook. 

2. To load the dataset and perform EDA using Pandas library.
  
3. Draw a scatter plot of the price of the product vs the revenue generated along with a trendline to look for relationship if any.

4. Now lets look at the number of products sold according to category by grouping the number of products sold with the product type. Further provide a fine visualization of obtained result on a pie chart. 
5. Now lets look at the total revenue generated according to shipping carrier by grouping the revenue with the shipping carrier type. Further provide a fine visualization of obtained result on a pie chart.

6. Similarly group attributes with different columns so as to look for trends in supply of the products.
